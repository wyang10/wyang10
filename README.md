## Hi there 👋 I’m Audrey~ 🚀

# About Me 🌱
I'm a Cloud Data Engineer focused on building scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient cloud data platforms.  
I specialize in turning raw, messy, multi-source data into trusted analytics layers and ML-ready pipelines  
through a mix of modern ELT, streaming systems, and strong distributed systems fundamentals.

## Quick Pitch 💬
🎓 MSCS @ Northeastern University (2022–2024)  
☁️ Focus: Cloud-Native Data Engineering — streaming(Kafka/Flink), orchestration(Airflow/Dagster), modeling(dbt)  
🔗 Connect: GitHub: wyang10 • LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/awhy

## Highlights 💡
- Cloud Data Systems: Airflow • dbt • Snowflake • BigQuery • Terraform  
- Streaming Architecture: Kafka/Flink • stateful processing • exactly-once pipelines  
- Distributed Systems: idempotency • back-pressure • partitioning strategies  
- ELT/ETL Optimization: incremental models • data quality • orchestration best practices  
- Feature Engineering: online/offline store design • feature pipelines

## Experience 🧩
**Data Engineer — LumiereX (Jan 2025 – Present)**  
Built core ELT frameworks, improved data quality layers, and optimized Spark jobs for cost/performance.  
Designed cloud-native data pipelines supporting analytics and ML-driven decisions.

**Software Engineer Intern — VisionX (Jan 2024 – Jul 2024)**  
Implemented scalable ingestion APIs, automated batch ETL workflows,  
and contributed to the design of ML feature extraction pipelines.

## Featured Projects 👨‍💻

### 🔷 [airflow_dbt_demo](https://github.com/wyang10/airflow_dbt_demo.git)   
A production-ready ELT & Data Quality Framework using **Airflow + dbt + Great Expectations + CICD**.  
Automates data ingestion, transformation, testing, and lineage into a reproducible orchestration system.

### 🔷 [Smote-Heart-Attack-ML](https://github.com/wyang10/Smote-Heart-Attack-ML.git)
End-to-End, Reproducible ML Pipeline Engineered a modular, production-style ML system for predicting in-hospital mortality.
Go from raw CSV → cleaned features → baseline models → reproducible CLI pipeline, with optional SMOTE to address severe class imbalance.

---

## How I Work 👯
- I design modular, observable pipelines that are easy to test, debug, and scale.  
- I prioritize trade-offs that maximize team velocity, reliability, and cloud spend efficiency.  
- I enjoy collaborations involving data modeling, pipeline quality, and distributed system design.
