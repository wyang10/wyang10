# About Me

I'm a Data Engineer specializing in building scalable, cost-efficient Lakehouse architectures and production-grade ELT pipelines. I design reliable batch & streaming systems that turn messy data into trusted analytics and ML-ready datasets.

---

## Quick pitch
- 🔭 Graduated: MSCS at Northeastern University (Jan 2022 – Dec 2024)  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced streaming patterns, cloud-native ETL optimizations  
- 💡 Focus: Airflow + dbt orchestration, Spark (PySpark) performance, data quality with Great Expectations  
- 📫 Contact: wyang10 (GitHub) • www.linkedin.com/in/awhy

---

## Highlights
- Built a production ELT & Data Quality Framework combining Airflow, dbt, and Great Expectations for automated, auditable orchestration.
- Hands-on with cloud data platforms across AWS & GCP — designed solutions balancing reliability, latency, and cost.
- Experienced in both batch and streaming ETL using Spark, Kafka, and Dataflow/EMR.

---

## Experience
- Data Engineer — LumiereX (Jan 2025 – Present)  
  Led core data platform initiatives, implemented ELT frameworks, and optimized Spark workloads for cost and speed.

- Software Engineer Intern — VisionX (Jan 2024 – Jul 2024)  
  Implemented scalable data ingestion pipelines and contributed to ML feature platforms.

## Featured Projects

- ![airflow_dbt_damo](https://github.com/wyang10/airflow_dbt_demo.git) 
  — ELT & Data Quality Framework combining Airflow + dbt + Great Expectations, production-ready orchestration for reproducible, turning manual workflows into an automated, auditable orchestration system.

- ![Macro-Market-Intelligence-Pipeline](https://github.com/wyang10/Macro-Market-Intelligence-Pipeline.git)
  — Automates the process of collecting, analyzing, and summarizing macroeconomic signals from multiple data sources — including EDGAR filings, and public macro indicators (VIX, DXY, UST10Y).It produces a weekly Markdown + HTML report featuring an AI-generated “Executive Summary 2.0,” which compresses market data into one-line macro insights.
