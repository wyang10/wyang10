# About Me 🌱 

🎯 I'm a Cloud Data Engineer specializing in building scalable, cost-efficient Lakehouse architectures and production-grade ELT pipelines. I design reliable batch & streaming systems that turn messy data into trusted analytics and ML-ready datasets.

## Quick pitch 💬
-  🎓 Graduated: MSCS at Northeastern University (Jan 2022 – Dec 2024)
-  🔹 Focus: Cloud-Native Data Engineering - streaming systems (Kafka/Flink), orchestration (Airflow/Dagster)
-  🔗 Contact: wyang10 (GitHub)  • www.github.com/wyang10   • www.linkedin.com/in/awhy

---

## Highlights 💡
- End-to-End Cloud Data Systems（Airflow, dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery, Terraform）
- Advanced Streaming Architecture（Kafka/Flink, stateful streaming, exactly-once semantics）
- Distributed Systems for Data Engineering（idempotency, back-pressure, partitioning）
- Large-Scale ETL/ELT Optimization（incremental models, orchestration patterns）
- Feature Engineering Systems（feature pipelines, online/offline store design）

---

## Experience 🧩
- Data Engineer — LumiereX (Jan 2025 – Present)  
  Led core data platform initiatives, implemented ELT frameworks, and optimized Spark workloads for cost and speed.

- Software Engineer Intern — VisionX (Jan 2024 – Jul 2024)  
  Implemented scalable data ingestion pipelines and contributed to ML feature platforms.

## Featured Projects 👨‍💻

- [airflow_dbt_damo](https://github.com/wyang10/airflow_dbt_demo.git) 
  — A production-ready ELT & Data Quality Framework, combining Airflow + dbt + Great Expectations.
  — Orchestration for reproducible, turning manual workflows into an automated, auditable orchestration system. 

- [Macro-Market-Intelligence-Pipeline](https://github.com/wyang10/Macro-Market-Intelligence-Pipeline.git)
  — Automates the process of collecting, analyzing, and summarizing macroeconomic signals from multiple data sources
  — including EDGAR filings, and public macro indicators (VIX, DXY, UST10Y). It produces a weekly Markdown + HTML report.
